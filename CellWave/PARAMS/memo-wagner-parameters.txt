tweaking notes:

 -- FOUND GREAT PARAMS
   ==> p=0.1888, Ca_peak = 1.15
   ==> p=0.0931, Ca_peak = 0.7 !!
   ==> p=0.7 --> drops to 0.1 from initial c=1
 --> FILE: caWagner-greatSet.ode.par:w
:q
 

 -- PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMS: -ok-phys-nonosc.ode.set
  -- min c=0.6, max c=1
  == unfortunately the eigvals are real
     Q: Can we tweak to get imag eigenvals at cmax?
    -- look at discr of linearized system

   I'm getting closer, I want
Max c=1 for p=0.25
Max c=.7 for p=0.09
-- bistable between 0.09< p <0.25
-- single stable state somewhere 0.25<p<1
oscillatory behavior near max c
overshoot under c=1.25

THEN identify params that determine the wave
speed !! 

Simplify the model to PWL

RUN 3D model with new parameters.
