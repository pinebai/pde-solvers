CellWave -- prototype whole cell modeling framework
---------------------------------------------------
TODO:
  --  better timesteppers:
      --  RK
      --  add split step for rxn, CVODE
      --  CVODE: separate integrators/grid -- asynchronous.

  --  add version tag/build number

  --  add CellWaveParameters -- contain solver info etc.

**
**   ParameterDocumentation          **** IMPORTANT!!
         --> add parameter descriptions for documentation!!
        ParameterDocumentation doc
        doc.header("name")
        doc.newParameter("dt","maximum timestep");

  --  use multiblock!! with Overture -- look at billsMatchedSquares.cmd
      --> no flux for Calcium, flow through for IP3

  --  CARTESIAN BOUNDARY GRIDS??
  --  use 'where' to compute the maxima in the components

  -   build cw codes on LC
  -   test runs
  -   look at neg. values near front
  -   work at nicer reaction term
  -   cookie cutter grids?
  -   nicer initial data/forcing
  -   try IP3 diffusion
  -   check the numerics:   
      steep fronts, diffusion test, rez study?
  -- need: dt calculator, rez study generator
  -   TZ solutions?

2003-03-11:
  -- I have a radial solver
     -- get the waves to trigger
     -- look at the outflow condition, looks funny.

2003-03-10:
  -> working on 'radialSolverSlepchenko2Buffer.C'
  --- idea: test radially symmetric solutions, and 
           compare with rxn's from a pt source on the wall
  --- NEED: 
        * add exact gaussian initial data: "GenericCalciumIP3Reaction"
        * do some tests
  --- Compare with results from full code in a box!!
      -- extract radial data with probes.
      -- could even extract pts at a rather dense resolution to match
         1-d code!!
  --- try 2d/3d code, see if the solutions are radially symmetric for source on the wall

  -> look at epithelial cell grids: what's needed to connect in 3D

2003-02-23:
  - heatKernel.h/.C --> use as initial data for IP3
  - try some runs with this, full buffering
  - could I do 3D radially symmetric waves? with the ode code?
    --> special case, add r terms to diffusion
    --> start from r=0, no flux bc?
  - WRITE UP the diffusion_ers.txt
    --> plot some heat kernel's
    --> show the error behavior
    --> try some waves
  - timings? standard cases: 20x20x20, 40x40x40, 80x80x80
  - look at the epi grids. fix the resolutions, connect in 3D


2003-01-26:
  - add probes
  - do diffusion tests
  - do egg tests
  - try non-buffered & buffered versions

  - look at epi grids --> could I connect them up?
  - add to the solver the correct bcs:
     1) dc/dn = 0 at intercell bdries,
     2) p is continuous!

2003-01-17:
  - look at the bc code --> should impose:
    * no flux on calcium at cell walls
    * flux through on IP3 at gap junctions.

2003-01-15:
  - meeting with AQ, showed new nucleus support
  - agreed to debug the box21 geometry
     >> box nucleus, box cell, looking at IP3 diffusion

2003-01-02:
  - Nuclei:  adding support for Nuclei/ a Nucleus
    * grids must contain the nucleus data
    * hence, save grids to a showfile!
  - Nuclei can be generated automatically, in epi2ogen
    * compute some reasonable radius and place one nucleus/cell
    * the nucleus-info is saved to a file
    * the file is input to cwGridGen
    * the .cmd file from epi2ogen could contain a line with '#@cwGridGen nuclei=xxx'
    

2002-12-10:
  - adding CVODE supprt -- see callingCVode.C
   --> work out how to do it, finish the example & writeup
  - release the fully explicit version


2002-11-27:
  - worked on grids
  - first 'release' cw_2002_11_27
  - merge DEC changes back to main source from ~/CellWave/releases/cw ...
  - 

2002-11-08:
  - worked out probes -- see probeSnippet.C
     -- add param file option
     -- use probeSnippet code to output the data
  - next: add initial data options to param file
  - next: work with the timestepper -- split step/cvode

2002-11-06:
  - fixed the param file for ode's 
  - fixed cellwave for Li Rinzel -- it fires again. Jolly good.
  - KEY for demo
    - Slepchenko 2 buf model
    - 3D egg
    - initial data options for reproducing the Slepchenko paper
    - some docs for the parameters
    - simple 3D epi/cellgrid complex 

  - TODO:
     * add release target to make file
     * add Slepchenko 2 buffer model
       -- get it to run on Linux
       -- get it to run on Dec
     * add initial data options: IP3 blob, homog, radial w/ grad
            -- same for Ca
   - Copy LiRinzel rxn -> Slepchenko...
     - Rxn, Solver
   - Keep same progr. model, not most general yet

2002-11-05:
  - fix the rxn code: I'm not getting trav. waves for some reason
    -- should I do the 1-d code? 
  - how do I check this? do some tests:
    * list them
    * make sure I can repeat them
    * collect the data automagically, process into a tex file/writeup


2002-11-04:
  - Was sick since 10/25 :(
  - DONE:
    * parameter file interface to LiRinzelWagner rxns
      -- see 'lirinzel.par' for an example
    * separated generic functionality to solver base class
      --> GenericSolver, GenericReaction
  - TODO:
      -- explicit buffer model, use modest k_off, k_on
      -- debug levels/debug code in systematic way
         ==> leave it in the code, but turn it off
      -- the Ca wave doesn't work right now
      -- epiGridBuilder:
         * given a polygon network, produce 2D or 3D overset gridfile system
      -- initial data from param file:
         ** parse the initial data type

2002-10-25:
  - DONE:
    * multiblock test -- billsMatchedSquares.cmd
  - In progress:
    * started ExplicitSolver : GeneralSolver -- separate solver modules
    * add parameter reader
    * allow more general species, towards adding buffers
    
2002-10-24:
  - DONE:
    * diffusion dt step size
    * main is now cellWaveMain, main exe is 'cellwave'
    * added CellWaveInfo, nothing there yet    
   
2002-10-21:
  - add param. files

2002-10-18:
  - started proto_ <date>_v4 ... try IP3 diffusion!!

  - proto_ <date>_v3 works
  - chemistry RHS is evaluated FORTRAN style
  - otherwise same as alpha_cw
  - oxcwave3D-test1 works on DEC/gps01, see Overture/primer, and CellWave dir.

2002-10-18:
  - alpha_cw works
  - alpha_cw  _v2 has correct initial data eval, and 
    runs sphericalCell_explicit_1mm.cmd ok,
    also 2D oocyte_1000_um.cmd ok
  - make sure grid is about 1mm size, with 10 um rez
  - dt, nsteps etc from command line
  - summary with CPU time at end

2002-10-17: continue alpha_cw_xx ( chem & the main prog)
- plan: first get initial data to work with Fortran loops
- then get RHS eval to work with Fortran loops
- then use Fortran ops for the laplacian??
- NEXT: 
    make alpha_cw
    - add make file targets, get it to compile & run


2002-10-17: TODO
 - build OXCWave on Dec's, setup for a demo on Monday
 - finish alpha_cw (=alpha_cw_2002_10_17), some flavor
 - prep. a 'release' to build for AQ
 - work on rxn code to encapsulate alpha_cw_2002_10_17 ideas 
   --> c++ class etc.

2002-10-17: REMARKS
* initial version will be 0.1.0
* pre 'cellwave' is OXCWave
* code versions/flavors:
   cartCellWave    = embedded bdry Cartesian grids
   overCellWave    = Overture/CellWave
* keep repo separate from distributions
  -- have a 'make release' target
  -- tag the released version
* dev versions are 0.x.y-year-mm-dd-<build number>
  -- generate automatic build numbers
  -- versions should be able to return their release number
* Serial/Parallel versions
   CellWave     single processor code
   CellWave-MP  threaded    (pthreads or OpenMP)
   CellWave-D   distributed (MPI)
