pde-solvers
===========

These are some of the big c++ research codes I wrote in my past life as a scientist at LLNL. These versions are no longer actively maintained.

This repository contains discretized partial differential equation (PDE) solvers for problems arising in fluid dynamics, cell biology and finance. 

Many of the codes depend on the [Overture framework](http://www.overtureframework.org/) and would require some work to build with the current releases. However, the 1-d test cases have no dependencies and should build on a Unix box. The purpose of the 1-d test codes was to demonstrate and study some of the physics and core numerical issues arising in the full 3-D solver.
