pde-solvers
===========

Discretized Partial Differential Equation solvers for problems arising in fluid dynamics, cell biology and finance. These are from my past life as a scientist at LLNL.

Many of the codes depend on the [Overture framework](http://www.overtureframework.org/) and would require some work to build with the current releases. However, the 1-d test cases have no dependencies and should build on a Unix box. The purpose of the 1-d test codes was to demonstrate and study some of the physics and core numerical issues arising in the full 3-Dsolver.
